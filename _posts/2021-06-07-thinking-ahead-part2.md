### TO UPDATE AND REWRITE FROM HERE ONWARDS...

The COVID pandemic has hit developing countries harder.  Government financial aid and fast vaccination rollout will enable richer countries to bounce back quickly.  In the developing world, government support and vaccination rollout are lacking behind.  Intermittent lockdowns have been devastating for many workers in the large informal sector in developing countries (such as hawkers, construction workers, domestic helpers).  As the economy shrank, debt repayments for infrastructure loans must be renegotiated, and many previously planned infrastructure projects, expenditures and loans will have to be postponed.  The near term outlook is not encouraging.  Tourism, an important source of revenues and employment in the developing world, is expected to recover only gradually in the years ahead.

Lean global supply chains have been enabled by highly sophisticated supply chain software and logistics cost reduction through increased shipping and transportation efficiencies.  Components are manufactured across many countries to take advantage of labor cost savings and tax incentives.  The assembled products are then shipped to major consumer markets in the advanced economies.  Product and component stocking and warehousing space throughout the global supply chain have been minimized.
COVID and other events in the last two years have disrupted shipping and business and now force many multinational corporations to rethink their lean global supply chains.  As many components and products are manufactured in China, one reaction has been to consider diversifying the supply chain by relocating some manufacturing to Southeast Asia or Mexico.  

In future, some labor-intensive manufacturing work in low-cost countries will be affected by increasing numbers of new highly automated plants in advanced countries.  Advanced manufacturing facilities do not need many low-skill workers; a small pool of high-skill workers is sufficient to program the robotic machines.  The labor cost advantage of offshore locations in developing countries is blunted and firms will prefer to site their capital-intensive production facilities near their markets.  

## Energy Transition

In a report using data up to 2018, McKinsey estimated that around 40% of climate changing greenhouse gases are traceable to the oil and gas industry and the fuels that it produced. 
Technological advancements have led to steep drops in the costs of solar and wind energy in recent years.  In many places, renewable energy production can now outcompete fossil-based energy production.  
Fossil fuels are, however, deeply embedded in our current world.  New coal and gas power stations are still being constructed in many locations.  In the years ahead, it can be expected that fossil fuel producers will compete more aggressively by lowering prices continuously to match the falling cost of renewables.  While some high-cost producers will exit, lower-cost producers will want to increase and accelerate production before their fossil assets become “stranded” - losing their value completely. 
Government and financing institutions are taking actions to support the transition to renewables.  However, the current trajectory for the replacement of fossil fuels with renewable energy still means that a global temperature rise of 1.5°C will be reached around 2030 and 2.6°C by the 2050s.  

Renewables power generation fails when the sun is not shining, or if the wind is not blowing every now and then.  One solution is battery power storage.  Roof-top solar panels coupled with home batteries have enabled many households to reduce their reliance on electricity generated in large fossil fuel power plants far away.  At the industrial scale, renewable energy generation with battery storage now supports many smaller decentralized mini-grids serving remote communities, such as a Tesla solar and battery plant in Kauai, Hawaii serving a population of around 80,000.
There is much speculation that cheap, surplus renewable energy will be widely available in future, enabling the electrolysis of water to produce hydrogen at a feasible cost.  Hydrogen fuel can potentially replace natural gas in many industrial processes, eliminating significant amounts of carbon emission.  Governments in the advanced economies are actively financing research into hydrogen transportation and storage – key cost challenges that must be overcome to achieve widespread adoption of “green” hydrogen.

Despite the temporary downturn caused by the COVID pandemic, demand for plastics and construction material such as cement, aluminum, steel is expected to grow strongly in developing countries in the years ahead.  The production of these materials creates severe environmental impacts including high energy and water consumption, and carbon and noxious air emissions.  
Waste disposal is another serious problem – plastic waste on beaches and construction waste illegally dumped along roads are common scenes in developing countries.  Government regulations and incentives are required to reduce consumption in the case of plastics, and to increase the volume of recycled material fed into production processes.  Less than 10% of plastics is recycled worldwide now.

Large-scale carbon capture and storage operations already exist today in a few locations - carbon dioxide is stripped from industrial processes and injected deep into the earth.   These infrastructures are expensive; unless there are government regulations or carbon pricing mechanisms, firms will have little incentive to make the costly carbon capture investments.
New cement, aluminum, steel, and petrochemical plants will need to be located in carefully masterplanned industrial parks with shared facilities for water recycling, waste treatment, carbon storage, energy and emission monitoring, and so on.  Decentralized solar and wind generation and battery storage are already feasible in many locations and can be incorporated into new urban and industrial master plans.  At some point in future, when hydrogen infrastructure become commercially feasible, hydrogen transportation and storage facilities will have to be planned.
