 Sustainability, widening rich-poor gaps, work-from-home transformations, autonomous vehicles, energy transition, industrial automation, smart cities – these emerging and continuously evolving issues, trends and technologies are firmly in the radar of municipal leaders, real estate developers and investors. These items are well covered by the media, academia, and strategic consulting firms – each analyzing, predicting, or advising from its own vantage point.

Masterplanners are hired to design spaces that respond to new trends and technologies. They need to stay updated, think deeply, but also intuitively, on how all these emerging trends and technologies will work out in our intricately interlinked urban and economic spaces. At the end of the day, municipal leaders and real estate developers, already well-advised by their bureaucracies and strategic consultants, will want to work closely with masterplanners to help design the development plans that will advance their political or business visions of better urban spaces tomorrow.

Having worked on large scale urban and industrial development masterplanning projects in more than twenty countries, many in the developing world, I have been frequently asked by clients to speculate on emerging issues, trends and innovations. As we move into a new normal in the post-COVID world, I wish to share my thoughts and insights on things that masterplanners will have to assimilate and respond to into their future designs.


### Sustainable Development Goals

The world faces a major challenge in global warming. Average global temperature rise since the 1800s is on course to peak at 2.6°C around 2050, taking into account current government pledges, according to the Climate Action Tracker organization. Scientists believe that a rise of 2°C will cause many irreversible and catastrophic changes to life on earth, including plant and animal extinction, rising sea levels from melting ice caps and increase in epidemics. 

About 9% of the world live in extreme poverty, according to the World Bank. Escalating climate change with more severe droughts, typhoons and altered marine food ecosystems, will impact more poor people in the developing world.

Over the years, the United Nations have refined goals and targets to end poverty and protect the earth from irreversible climate change impacts, culminating in a set of 17 Sustainable Development Goals currently adopted among member countries. To achieve these goals, governments and businesses must invest in health, education, agriculture, and infrastructure; take actions to achieve food security, provide clean water and sanitation facilities, protect against flooding and typhoons, create employment, ensure affordable housing, reduce waste and promote recycling, switch to clean energy and so on. 

### Infrastructure For The Developing World

The developing world needs the financing provided by global institutions for many basic infrastructure projects; and the support of businesses and consumers in the advanced economies to buy goods and services produced in the developing world; stimulating economic growth, which will then enable those infrastructure loans to be repaid.</p>

Water supply, wastewater collection and treatment, flood alleviation, port upgrading, economic zone development, and so on – these are critical projects that need to be carefully and creatively masterplanned in many overcrowded developing world cities with chaotic landuse arrangements and weak urban planning systems.

In the more developed world, ‘green’ infrastructure such as urban parks and the rewilding of obsolete industrial land to act as flood retention areas or natural wastewater treatment facilities, are gaining popularity. In Singapore, stormwater runoff in the urban area is harvested for industrial as well as domestic consumption, made possible by sophisticated collection and filtering infrastructure and a well-run development planning and control system. 

The political environments in countries such as China and Singapore empower governments to acquire private land and resettle population to create green infrastructure corridors.  In many other developing cities, government-led resettling of residents is often politically difficult.  Traditional ‘grey’ infrastructure that can be overlaid onto existing landuse arrangements, and enhanced with some technological adaptation, are often the more feasible solution.  For instance, to lay sewers across crowded informal settlements, Indian engineers have developed innovative methods for non-disruptive tunneling under narrow crooked roadways.   In Medellín, Colombian planners created public outdoor escalators as mobility infrastructure for connecting the poorest informal settlements perched on valley slopes to the city center on the valley floor.

### Throwaway Consumption

Many things are thrown away regularly in the modern economy, including packaging and cheap consumer goods.  There is, however, a growing pushback around the world for a more sustainable lifestyle based on the mantra of reuse, recycle, reduce, repurpose, repair, rent, resale and sharing. 
In the last decade, the fast fashion industry has grown exponentially with consumers in the advanced countries continuously buying trendy, relatively low cost, mass-produced clothing.  Some out-of-fashion clothes are donated and end up being sold cheaply as second-hand clothing in the developing world.  Nonetheless, the volume of discarded clothing continues to climb at alarming rates across the world.  
Reduced buying by consumers will shrink the fast fashion industry and lower the carbon footprint of textile production, which is currently at about the same level as the automotive industry, according to the Ellen MacArthur Foundation.  It is conceivable that if new sustainable consumption trends take hold, repair and rental services will become more prominent in future urban retail spaces.
On the flip side, the readymade garment industry has powered the rapidly growing Bangladesh economy and contributes about 80% of exports.  Four million workers, 85% of which are illiterate women, are employed.  The COVID pandemic has been devastating for these workers and the economy as factories close due to supply chain disruptions.   Developing countries that are benefitting from low-cost production of consumer goods for advanced countries will be impacted when throwaway consumption is reduced.

### ESG Investing

Financial returns are no longer the sole focus of business.  More multinational corporations and financing entities are now committed to ESG (Environment, Social and Corporate Governance) investments.   Corporations that do not provide sufficient ESG disclosure will increasingly face greater regulatory, investor and consumer scrutiny.  
Industrial park developers targeting ESG conscious manufacturers will have to provide sustainably developed spaces and green facilities such as wastewater treatment and recycling plants, waste heat and waste material exchange etc., at competitive costs.  Commercial property developers are responding to the strongly growing demand for green buildings with innovative net-zero developments.  In these developments, renewable energy generation (through solar panels, wind turbines etc., and sometimes on-site), coupled with battery power storage, can meet the total demands of carefully designed highly-energy-efficient buildings.  
Large scale urban, industrial and tourism developments that impact local communities, especially if resettlement is involved, needs to take into account community concerns and ensure fair compensation.   Increasingly, investors are unwilling to participate in tourism projects or locate in industrial parks where existing communities have been displaced, with lingering resentment against perceived unfair compensation. 

### Landuse Transformations

Office workers in most of the world have been working from home for over a year.  By now, employers and employees both speculate that hybrid work arrangements – such as 50% work from home, 50% office hot-desking – will become permanent fixtures.  Continuous refinement of hybrid work arrangements will enable business and government to better respond to the next pandemic.  There are also benefits in normal times: businesses can reduce real estate costs and many workers can save time lost on long commutes. 

The notable exception is China, where most office workers have returned to their workplaces since mid-2020.  Work-from-home lasted only a few brief months, as the government has quickly brought the pandemic under control.  Chinese managers do not have a comparatively long period of time for assessing work-from-home arrangements, and it is probably less risky for them to revert to familiar work arrangements.

Hybrid work, as well as lesser business travel with greater acceptance of video conferencing, will reduce the number of workers and the demand for office, retail, entertainment, and cultural space in many city centers.  As commercial space demand drops, some office and hotel towers can be converted or redeveloped as residential apartments.  More affordable housing within the city center will be welcomed in many cities around the world.    

These trends may not alter currently prevalent urban design concepts for creating vibrant city centers, but municipal financial support for arts, cultural and other place-making activities will be curtailed as commercial property tax receipts fall.  

With lesser commuting overall, congestion and carbon emission impacts from driving to work in low-density sprawling cities are reduced and air quality improves.  At the same time, public transit ridership will stabilize at lower levels than before the COVID pandemic.  

In the United States, Canada, and Australia, where low-density suburban development dominates, efforts have been made in recent decades to encourage higher-density transit-oriented development.  However, in a post-Covid world where a significant proportion of work will be done at home, spacious suburban living has become desirable again for office workers.

Even before the COVID pandemic, online retailing has been gaining significant ground in the advanced countries.  Many suburban malls in the United States have closed.  In densely populated Asian cities, so far malls have survived better.  However, the expert consensus is to expect continued expansion of online commerce and reduction of demand for physical retail space in developing countries over the next decade.

With the rapid rise of e-commerce and consumer desire for fast delivery, demand for many smaller warehousing spaces spread across the metropolitan areas have soared.
