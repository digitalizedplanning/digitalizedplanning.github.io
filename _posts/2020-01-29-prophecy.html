Office workers in most of the world have been working from home for over a year.  By now, employers and employees both speculate that hybrid work arrangements – such as 50% work from home, 50% office hot-desking – will become permanent fixtures.  Continuous refinement of hybrid work arrangements will enable business and government to better respond to the next pandemic.  There are also benefits in normal times: businesses can reduce real estate costs and many workers can save time lost on long commutes. 

The notable exception is China, where most office workers have returned to their workplaces since mid-2020.  Work-from-home lasted only a few brief months, as the government has quickly brought the pandemic under control.  Chinese managers do not have a comparatively long period of time for assessing work-from-home arrangements, and it is probably less risky for them to revert to familiar work arrangements.

Hybrid work, as well as lesser business travel with greater acceptance of video conferencing, will reduce the number of workers and the demand for office, retail, entertainment, and cultural space in many city centers.  As commercial space demand drops, some office and hotel towers can be converted or redeveloped as residential apartments.  More affordable housing within the city center will be welcomed in many cities around the world.    
These trends may not alter currently prevalent urban design concepts for creating vibrant city centers, but municipal financial support for arts, cultural and other place-making activities will be curtailed as commercial property tax receipts fall.
