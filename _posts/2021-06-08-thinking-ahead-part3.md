## Electric and Autonomous Vehicles

The production cost of electric cars is expected to fall below the production cost of gasoline cars in this decade.  In a future where electricity is generated predominantly by renewables, electric vehicles will help remove most of the 11% of global greenhouse emission from fossil fuels burned in combustion engine passenger vehicles (estimates from ourworldindata.org).   

Fossil fuels burned in trucks contribute another 7% of global greenhouse gas emission.  Manufacturers are actively switching over to the production of electric trucks.  Some haulage in large countries such as the United States cover longer distances (for example, more than one thousand kilometers) than in places such as Europe, where typical haulage distances fall within current electric truck battery ranges.  Startup companies are attempting to produce hydrogen fuel cell trucks that can be deployed on long distance haulage.

Electric vehicles are quieter and eliminate the noxious tailpipe emission of combustion engine vehicles.  In a future world with electric vehicles only, there many new possibilities for the re-design of roads, buildings, and urban spaces.  However, air pollution is not eliminated as all running vehicles create particulate matter emission from the wear and tear of brakes, tires, and road surfaces.  To further reduce urban air pollution, a significant proportion of electric car commute will have to be replaced by higher capacity public transit trips.  With lesser electric vehicles, the environmental impact of old battery disposal can also be reduced. 

Self-driving or autonomous vehicles are appearing on the horizon.  Trucking, taxi, and ride-sharing companies are watching these developments enthusiastically as they will be able to increase profitability by eliminating drivers.  On the other hand, truck and taxi drivers and economic policy makers will have to prepare for this not too distant massive job loss reality. 

A future where all road vehicles are autonomous will be safer as human driver errors are removed through presumably more reliable artificial intelligence navigation systems.  Road space can be reduced.  Autonomous vehicles can drop off passengers and move on to another assignment or return to a remote base.  Requirements for parking space will decrease, especially in commercial areas. 

In an all-autonomous vehicle future, there will be many opportunities for reconfiguring urban spaces.  For the next decade, there will probably still be a mix of autonomous and non-autonomous vehicles on the roads, a situation that does not provide clarity for planning urban spaces for the longer term.

## Smart Cities

The term “Smart City” first gained popularity in the years around 2010.  Technology companies such as CISCO and IBM and many management consulting companies started to create a comprehensive narrative around a range of new technology to support municipal operations.  

In the last ten to fifteen years, many new Smart Cities have been planned and existing cities have scrambled to adopt and announce their own smart city initiatives.  

Arup, the British engineering consulting firm, conceived the Dongtan Eco-City Master Plan in 2005.  Environmental sustainability measures and features were explicitly incorporated and detailed in the master plan for the new Chinese city, including wetlands rewilding, wastewater recycling, buildings with green roofs and natural ventilation, localized energy production through wind farms and solar panels and so on.  Although Dongtan was not built, it inspired other smart eco-cities such as Masdar in Abu Dhabi and Tianjin Eco-City in China, which now has a population of several hundred thousand.  More importantly, these precedents help spur the incorporation of emerging infrastructure technology into master plans for new urban and industrial areas.

Around 2013, Songdo, a new Smart City in Korea, touted the availability of Wi-Fi in public spaces and electronic panels at railway station exits indicating waiting times for connecting buses.  In less than a decade, these features have become commonplace in many cities and are no longer considered Smart.  Sidewalk Toronto, a Smart City proposed by Google in 2017 and canceled in 2020, would have had features such as garbage collection robots, a pay-as-you-throw system, landuses that could be changed dynamically based on Big Data collected surreptitiously on residents and their movements.  It is conceivable that in the near future, these features could appear in many new smart urban developments.

Any city or master plan could become Smart by incorporating some of the wide range of new innovative technologies that are continuously emerging.  The right set of smart technology to select depends on the socio-economic, environmental, governance and operational challenges and issues that governments, planners and stakeholders have identified; and the cost-benefit from new technology adoption.  Developers and facility managers must also accept that there will always be newer, better, and unforeseeable technological innovations a few years later while contemplating current smart city offerings.

## 15-Minute City

Every now and then, an urban planning concept that has already been deeply entrenched in one location gets reformulated with excitement in another location. For instance, the concept of transit-oriented development gained popularity in 1990s as a reaction against suburban sprawl in the United States.  American cities such as New York and Chicago have been transit-oriented developments since the last century.  There are also many cities in East Asia and Latin America that have been planned and developed in tandem with mass transit lines before the term transit-oriented development became popular.

The 15-Minute City was promoted by Paris mayor Anne Hidalgo and technology professor Carlos Moreno in 2020.  By walking or cycling 15 minutes, all residents will be able to reach schools, shops, community facilities and workplaces.  This concept, as any urban planning graduate will appreciate, draws on the neighborhood unit concept propounded by Clarence Perry in the 1920s and mixed-use development advocated by Jane Jacobs in the 1960s.  However, the reconceived 15-Minute City is a brilliant way of communicating desired urban living that reaches deep into the minds of urban citizens. 

Neighborhoods with supporting facilities within walking distances have long been a way of life in many large-scale high-density masterplanned new towns developed from the 1960s onwards in England, Scandinavia, East Asia, Western Europe, and especially Eastern Europe.

The 15-minute city concept, however, will help motivate local governments and planners to re-examine existing non-masterplanned neighborhoods in lower-density cities to identify areas lacking convenient access to public facilities.  Interventions to achieve the 15-minute city could include new public transit services, bikeways and sidewalk improvements, new facilities, and increasing landuse zoning density. 

Balancing employment opportunities with residential population in a 15-minute neighborhood is considerably more complex.  Local shops, social facilities and smaller manufacturing establishments can provide a limited amount of employment, drawing workers from the neighborhood.  Workers often find better paying job opportunities in other neighborhoods.  

Many knowledge workers that commute every day to central business districts are expected to be working from home in the future.  However, a much larger portion of workers need to be physically present at their workplaces, often in the suburbs. According to Alain Bertaud in a Bloomberg interview, nearly three-quarters of commuting in Paris are from suburbs to suburbs, mostly by driving, while the radial train network converges on the city center.  Better public transit serving peripheral employment locations is needed to reduce car trips.

In China and other developing countries, there are many large scale manufacturing operations with tens of thousands of workers in a single location, often a masterplanned industrial park.  Workers are recruited across the country, usually from the rural areas, or even from other neighboring countries, and they are housed in dormitories.  While many lower wage workers will have to eventually return to their villages with their savings, some higher wage workers will want to settle down in their new city.  These has led to the masterplanning of many new industrial-urban suburbs, especially in China, where an industrial park development becomes the catalyst for a new urban district or city.  Some of these industrial-urban developments, such as the Suzhou Industrial Park, have grown spectacularly over the last ten to twenty years.

## New Way of Masterplanning

Traditional master plans envisaged a twenty or thirty year development timeframe.  Demand for residential, industrial, and commercial land are forecast and a blueprint for land, infrastructure and social facilities arrangement and development is then prepared.  The key assumption is that the way we live, work, and play will remain more or less the same within the next twenty years.

Rapid, radical, structural transformations are more likely.  Pressure to act on global warming will intensify; technologies such as automotive vehicles, artificial intelligence, and automation will replace workers and disrupt urban spaces.  We fear but cannot discount a new pandemic that will strike us with profound unforeseen changes, as COVID did.  

In such a fast changing environment, some large scale infrastructure with long paybacks may have to be re-conceived as smaller decentralized and phased modules.  Master plans will increasingly become useful only for the foreseeable five years ahead.  Plans will have to be reviewed and modified continuously.   With rapid advancement in digital technology, master plans will become digital designs that can be reassessed and tweaked on demand.
Planners will still need a deep grounding in knowledge of how technology and trends have shaped urban spaces in the past to help them navigate through the deluge of information on nascent technology and trends; and to analyze how these could possibly re-shape the cities of the future.  In addition, they will need to acquire and master new digital skills to create dynamic master plans that respond to rapidly evolving and radically different urban spaces in the not too distant future.
